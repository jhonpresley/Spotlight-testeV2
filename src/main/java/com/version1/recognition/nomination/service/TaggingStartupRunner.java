/**
 * Runs one rule-flag pass at startup.
 * <p>
 * Rule flags are derived data - they are whatever the current checks say about
 * the current rows - so recomputing them on boot keeps them honest after a
 * migration, a seed load, or a change to the rules themselves. Without this, a
 * freshly-seeded database would sit there showing no flags at all until somebody
 * happened to submit a nomination, which reads as "nothing wrong with any of
 * these" rather than "nobody has looked yet".
 * <p>
 * Only {@link FlagSource#RULE} flags are touched; AI flags are preserved.
